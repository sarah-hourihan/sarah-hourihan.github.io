## Grad School at USC!

After a relaxing few months off following my graduation from Vanderbilt, I am thrilled to be embarking on a new adventure - grad school! I am so excited to formally share on my blog that I am starting my graduate studies at the University of Southern California in the Integrative and Evolutionary Biology (IEB) PhD program. 

I will be working with Dr. David Raichlen, who leads the [Evolutionary Biology of Physical Activity Lab](https://www.raichlenlab.com/). Ever since I came across the field of evolutionary medicine a few years ago, I have been eager to get involved in this research. By understanding and accounting for the deep histories of human populations, we can better understand the origins of certain diseases—and look for ways to prevent them at their source, if possible. For most of human history, humans lived active lifestyles as foragers. Now, in the industrialized world, sedentary lifestyles are the new norm, and there has been a surge in non-communicable diseases even within the past few decades. 

In the Evolutionary Biology of Physical Activity Lab, I will broadly be studying how the mismatch between humans’ evolved adaptations and modern industrialized lifestyles have led to the rise of diseases like type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and cardiovascular disease. Through studying the origins of these non-communicable diseases, we can find ways to prevent them and develop treatments to ameliorate their devastating effects.

While I may share more on my blog about my PhD application process, my decision to go to USC and work with Dr. Raichlen came down to a few things: close research interests, supportive communities at all levels (lab, department, and university), a compatible mentorship style with my advisor, and location. The amount of things to do in LA is endless, and I am grateful to be in a city with so much to explore when I am not researching. Campus is beautiful, LA is exciting, and every day has been sunny so far…I couldn’t ask for much more!

One of my favorite activities as a child was going to the Field Museum in Chicago. Arguably, that might have been what initially got me interested in evolutionary biology. I love that the LA Natural History Museum is right next to campus and I have free admission whenever I want to visit!

When I got invited to do an official campus visit in March, I went on a little outing to the Getty Center during my free time. It did not disappoint!

I still can't believe I live mere blocks away from Walt Disney Concert Hall! I am really looking forward to going to some LA Philharmonic concerts.

Before my program began, my roommate and I took a day trip to Laguna Beach. California is a beautiful state and has so many different landscapes to offer. I can't wait to explore more!

## Final Words

I want to end by expressing gratitude for the experiences, opportunities, and people who have helped make this dream a reality. Looking back on my life, there are so many things that had to line up for me to be where I am today. 

I am so excited for this new adventure - let’s get to work!
