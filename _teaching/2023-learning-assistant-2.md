Beginning Fall 2023, I have served as a Learning Assistant for Introduction to Biology I (BSCI 1510) and Introduction to Biology II (BSCI 1511). In this role, I lead productive small-group discussions, challenge students to think deeper about challenging concepts, and promote inclusion and belonging in the classroom.
