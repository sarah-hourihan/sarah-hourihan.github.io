Hi, I'm Sarah! I am passionate about biology and maximizing participation in STEM. Currently, I am completing my undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University, where I study Biological Sciences and Music (Clarinet). I research birdsong evolution in the Creanza Lab at Vanderbilt and serve as a laboratory assistant for the Hu Lab at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
