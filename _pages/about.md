This is Sarah Hourihan's home on the web!

Hi, I'm Sarah! I am currently completing my undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University, where I study Ecology, Evolution, & Organismal Biology (EEOB) and Music (Clarinet). For the past 3 years, I have researched in the Creanza Lab at Vanderbilt, where I investigate birdsong evolution. Birdsong is a learned behavior that functions in species recognition and mate attraction; thus, it has the potential to reinforce population differentiation.
