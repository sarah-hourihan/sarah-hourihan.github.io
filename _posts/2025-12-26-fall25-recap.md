- **Three** moments of connection
- **Two** important tasks completed
- **One** area for growth in the future

### Five areas of growth
It is important to track progress - not only for propelling projects forward - but to celebrate what has been done so far. During the first semester of my 2nd year of PhD, my research ramped up more. My first year was all about formulating research ideas, elucidating what I found most fascinating, and determining which projects have the most impact and potential for me. Now that I have a more complete vision for my research, I have started to move more wholly into the ‘execution’ stage. Of course, I am still adding details and tweaking plans as I go, but the foundation feels like it is there. It has been exciting and enjoyable to be more focused on research this semester. The past few months have been full of growth as I am learning new skills and methods. Here are five areas of growth that come to mind:

1. Building my first machine learning model using raw accelerometer data to predict human activity.
2. Processing and analyzing data from large national datasets, such as NHANES, using high-performance computing.
3. Learning more about multilevel modeling and longitudinal data analysis through a biostatistics course.
4. Getting more familiar with wearable devices, including Axivity and Garmin, and how to leverage them for health applications.
5. Expanding my knowledge through efficient and effective literature review.

### Four highlights outside of lab
AKA the things I enjoy doing to recharge and prevent research burn out:

1. Reading. I love reading during my commute to campus, before bed, and listening to audiobooks while driving/walking/doing chores. Out of the 64 books I read this year, my favorites include: _The Women_ by Kristin Hannah, _The Freedom of Self-Forgetfulness_ by Tim Keller, _Atmosphere_ by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and _Sunrise on the Reaping_ by Suzanne Collins.
2. Playing in an orchestra. Music has always been a huge part of my life, so I am grateful to be able to continue with this passion of mine through a community orchestra.
3. Eating delicious food in LA! I am so blessed to live in one of the nation’s food capitals. Top spots from this past semester: Porto’s Bakery, Sun Nong Dan, Simpang Asia, Molly Tea, and Mr. Dragon Noodle House.
4. Exploring LA and the greater Southern California area with friends. Favorite places:

### Three moments of connection 
One of the most special parts of being a researcher is being part of scientific communities. On micro and macro scales, I love engaging with others who are curious about or already passionate about science. Here are three moments of connection from this past semester that I look back on fondly:

1. Being a guest speaker for the USC Joint Educational Project (JEP) Medical STEM Program. Through this opportunity, I got to share my academic journey and research with a class of 3rd graders. Their excitement and curiosity reminds me of my own scientific beginnings; how passionate and curious I was about the world around me. Sadly, as people become older, they seem to ask fewer questions - perhaps out of less curiosity or fear of asking a 'silly' question. However, children are SO curious and eager to ask questions and participate. Outreach activities like these hold a special place in my heart because I believe that they can plant seeds for big dreams. Even though my parents did not go to college and before I knew what research entailed and how to get involved in it, science lessons at school, museum visits, and guest speakers were the seeds that grew into my love for science.
2. Planning events as the USC Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) social chair. This semester, I had the privilege of planning two coffee socials for the PhD WiSE community at USC. It is super uplifting to have a community of women around me who are also pursuing their PhDs. Through these coffee socials, I enjoyed chatting with others about their experiences in and outside of grad school. Plus, I love coffee!
3. Partaking in monthly lab meetings. Even though my lab is small and one-on-one chats usually suffice, we realized that it would be helpful to have monthly lab meetings. They have been a great time for us to check in with each other, share updates, workshop writing, practice presentations, chat about interesting papers, and more. I have really enjoyed this dedicated, intentional time with the lab.

### Two important tasks completed

1. Applying for the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship. This fellowship supports New Americans, immigrants, and children of immigrants as they work toward their academic and professional goals. One of the application essays asked how being a New American has shaped who you are and your accomplishments. This prompted so much reflection and deeper exploration into my identity as an interracial adoptee. Honestly, it was very cathartic to capture these complex feelings and put them into words. It would be an honor to be a part of the PD Soros community, whose fellows all have such inspiring, unique stories.
2. Submitting my research abstract for the upcoming AABA conference (which got accepted!) and applying for the AABA Travel Award. The prompt for the travel award was quite interesting! For the application, I had to write an op-ed explaining why biological anthropology is important and why it should remain a funding priority. This question is especially pertinent at this time of reduced funding for science, and it certainly helped me formulate my thoughts better.

### One area for growth in the future

1. Keeping a more consistent and structured schedule. This will make a huge difference in several areas of my life, so I am eager to make this happen. I am naturally a night owl, but I am challenging myself to have a more consistent schedule, especially in the morning. While I am fortunate to be able to set my own schedule, this has led to some strange working hours. At times, my life has felt a bit off kilter. I am craving more structure with my schedule and routines. I have a few branching tasks that will help me make this happen: (1) going to sleep earlier and waking up earlier, (2) being off my devices before sleeping to get better quality sleep, (3) time blocking my daily schedule more, and (4) prepping clothes, backpack, and lunch ahead of time to make it faster to leave in the morning.

This semester was full of progress, learning, growth, and great memories. I am excited to see what the next one brings!
