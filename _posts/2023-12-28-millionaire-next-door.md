*Disclaimer: I understand that money and personal finances are sensitive topics. I am a little nervous to be discussing personal finance on my blog; however, this is an area that is interesting me. I also believe it is important to learn about personal finances, so I want to use my blog as a platform to share what I have learned. I understand that everyone's financial situations are different; I am only speaking from my own experiences. I am in no way a personal finance expert—in fact, most of what I share will be content I have learned from books, podcasts, and blogs. Please make sure to consult other sources before making any financial decisions. 

# _The Millionaire Next Door_ Reflection

2023 is the year I have truly taken initiative over my personal finances. Growing up, financial literacy is not something that was very emphasized for me at home or at school. Over the years, I acquired an elementary understanding of personal finance through interactions with my parents and asking questions. Thankfully, my parents encouraged living below our means, building savings if possible, and always paying bills and credit cards. These are excellent lessons, and I am grateful to my parents for instilling them in me. 

However, there is a lot more to personal finance than spending habits and savings. For example, the stock market, bonds, CDs, high-yield savings accounts, credit cards, investing, portfolios, assets, liabilities, IRAs, 401Ks, tax-advantaged accounts, tax-disadvantaged accounts, etc. etc. As a young adult who is soon entering the "real world," I feel a personal responsibility to learn about these areas. I want to set myself up to live comfortably and have control over my finances. 

When I embarked on what I call my "personal finance journey" this year, I was slightly overwhelmed by how much there was to learn. However, I was down for the challenge, and I knew that if I could focus on one thing at a time, I would be moving in the right direction. Upon recommendation from one of my friends who is very into personal finance, I started my journey by reading _The Millionaire Next Door_ by Drs. Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko.

_The Millionaire Next Door_ was published in 1998. Although the stats and some of the statements are outdated, much of the book remains relevant today. The main focus of the book (in my opinion) is to show that millionaire status is achieved largely through lifestyle choices and smart investment decisions. The authors make the distinction between income and wealth. Income is how much someone makes while wealth is how much money is saved and accumulated over the years. Although Person A could have a huge annual income, they may not be wealthy due to a lavish lifestyle. On the other hand, Person B may earn significantly less than Person A, but they are more wealthy because they live frugally and invest their money. 

This was an excellent book to kick off my personal finance journey because it mostly focuses on lifestyle and frugality. There isn't too much technical jargon, which made it very accessible. When the authors introduced a new technical concept, they made sure to explain what it means. 

I finished _The Millionaire Next Door_ feeling optimistic about my future. I learned that it doesn't necessarily require a huge income to become wealthy. As someone who is in the process of establishing a career and deciding what path to go down, this gave me some reassurance that it's not _all_ about income. Rather, there are different areas of my life I can control that will set me up for a financially comfortable future. I realize that this book probably oversimplifies wealth accumulation, but I support the general message of living below your means, if possible. I would definitely recommend _The Millionaire Next Door_ for others who are interested in personal finance but don't know where to begin. I even recommend it those who have been at it for a while, as there is certainly something to learn.

I rated _The Millionaire Next Door_ 3 out of 5 stars. I enjoyed the message of frugal living and the glimpses into the lifestyles of most millionaires. However, about a third of the way through, the content began to feel quite redundant.

# _The Millionaire Next Door_ Notes

As I read _The Millionaire Next Door_, I noted some of the statements that were especially intriguing to me. Below are my notes, organized by chapter. This is not meant to be a summary of the book.

## Preface

- 90% of millionaires live in homes valued at under $300,000. **Remember, this book was written in the 1990s. $300K in 1998 is comparable to ~$552K in 2023.
- These millionaires report that they are extremely satisfied with life. Although they _could_ live more lavishly, they do not, and they remain happy with this decision. 

## Introduction

- Wealth is NOT the same as income. If you make a good income each year and spend it all, you are not getting wealthier. Wealth is what you accumulate.
- Wealth is often the result of a lifestyle of hard work, perseverance, planning, and self-discipline.
- 80% of America’s millionaires are first-generation rich (meaning their wealth is not generational).

## Meet the Millionaire Next Door

- Millionaires on average live on less than 7% of their wealth. They live well below their means.
  - This percentage may have changed since 1998.
- Many people who display a high-consumption lifestyle have little or no investments, income-producing assets, stocks, bonds, private businesses, etc.
- Millionaire status can be attained in one generation.
  - Most people who become millionaires have confidence in their own abilities. They don’t believe that one must be born wealthy.
  - People of modest backgrounds who believe only the wealthy produce millionaires are more likely to remain non-affluent.

## Frugal Frugal Frugal

- Big spenders are sensationalized by popular media.
  - We learn hyperspending is the main reward for having a high income.
- Most people won’t become wealthy if they are married to people who are wasteful or hyperspenders.
  - Be careful who you marry and make sure to have conversations about finances and spending habits.
- Most millionaires plan and budget. They may not have the highest income but they accumulate wealth through financial planning.
- “Pay yourself first” = Invest before spending the remainder of your income on food, clothes, home, credit, etc.
  - Invest _a minimum_ of 15% of your annual realized income, if possible.
- Financially independent people are happier than those in their same income/age cohort who are not financially secure.
- The higher one’s net worth, the better one is at minimizing realized income.
    - Minimize tax by investing heavily in tax-free municiples, tax-sheltered real estate, and stocks with unrealized gains.

## Time, Energy, and Money

- Those with high incomes aren’t necessarily wealthy.
- The earlier one starts investing one’s income, the greater the opportunity to accumulate wealth.
- The longer one stays in school, the longer one postpones producing an income and building wealth.
- Planning and wealth accumulation correlate even among investors with modest incomes.

## Economic Outpatient Care

- "Economic Outpatient Care": Financial gifts or help given to adult children from parents.
- The more dollars adult children receive from their parents, the fewer they accumulate.
- On the flip side, adult children given fewer dollars tend to accumulate more.

## Affirmative Action, Family Style

- Rules for affluent parents and productive children:
    1. Never tell children their parents are wealthy.
    2. Teach your children discipline and frugality.
    3. Assure children won’t realize you’re affluent until after they’ve established their own adult lifestyle and profession.
