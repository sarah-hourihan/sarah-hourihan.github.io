# My journey as a reader
One of my favorite activities to do in my free time is read. My reader status really took off when I was in sixth grade. Yes, of course I read bedtime stories growing up, little chapter books throughout elementary school, and class readings at school. However, it was around sixth grade when everything changed. It was at this point that I began to find books that truly appealed to me. Additionally, my older sister and a couple of my friends were also very into reading, which made reading a fun activity that brought us together. Since then, I have basically always had a book that I'm reading. Even as life got busier, I have tried to prioritize reading since it adds so much value and joy to my life. 

# Why I love reading
Though a lot of the following remarks are cheesy and cliché, I'm going to share them anyway: I love the way books can transport us into different lives and worlds. I love the strong emotions that characters and plots can evoke. I love when stories come to life and I can escape my present circumstances. I love exploring complex emotions through reading. I love how intellectually stimulating books can be and the abundance of knowledge I have gained through this pastime that brings me so much joy. Reading has changed my life in so many profound ways, and my hope is for everyone to find books that ignite this level of passion for them.

# Check out my Goodreads
I have been tracking my reading on Goodreads since ~2015. Here is [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43349595-sarah) if you want to be friends with me and stay up to date on what I have been reading recently!

# Criteria for favorite books
Here, I am sharing a list of my all-time favorite books! Since a lot of people know or find out that I am a reader, I sometimes get asked for recommendations. The books listed here are some of my go-to recommendations. To form this list, I scrolled through the 545 books I have tagged as “read” on Goodreads and noted books that are especially memorable to me. They can be meaningful for a plethora of reasons - maybe they hold a lot of childhood nostalgia, maybe they transported me to a new place with particular palpability, maybe they taught me an important life lesson, maybe they changed my perspective on something for the better. Regardless of the reason, these books (out of the hundreds of others I have read) have stuck with me over the years. They’re the books whose characters came to life and whose content changed my life for the better. The ones that continue to cross my mind on a regular basis. 

There’s a good mixture of genres represented here, as well as fiction and nonfiction. I hope this list will have a book for everyone that may come across it! This list was created at the end of 2024, so more will most definitely be added in the future as I continue to (hopefully) read amazing books. Feel free to reach out to me with your own recommendations - I love adding to my what seems to be never-ending TBR list!

# My favorite books (in no particular order because it’s too hard to rank them!)

## Harry Potter (series) - _J.K. Rowling_

<img src="/images/harry-potter.jpg" alt="Harry Potter" width="175" height="250">

I read this series for the first time in middle school and absolutely love it! The entire series has so much childhood nostalgia attached to it. I feel like I don't need to do much explaining since this is a well-loved book for many people. The world building and characters are simply top tier. Also, I love the fandom that has sprouted from the books and the resulting movies, theme parks, and stores. 

## The Book Thief - _Markus Zusak_

<img src="/images/the-book-thief.jpg" alt="The Book Thief" width="175" height="250">

_The Book Thief_ is a very moving historical fiction novel set in Germany during the World War II era. It was able to transport me back in time as if I was there with the characters. I learned a lot about what it was like back then. Also the writing was beautiful and I felt a strong connection to all of the characters. The ending shocked me and I still think about it to this day. I have re-read _The Book Thief_ a few times and each time, I still find it as compelling as the first time I read it. Also, it has a solid movie adaptation to watch after reading. 

## The Kite Runner - _Khaled Hosseini_

<img src="/images/the-kite-runner.jpg" alt="The Kite Runner" width="175" height="250">

I read _The Kite Runner_ in high school for one of my English classes. Sometimes, being 'forced' to read a book for class makes it not as enjoyable, but my high school English teachers generally did a good job with their choices. I wasn't expecting to love this book as much as I did since I was forced to read it for class. I was pleasantly surprised in the best way because I LOVED this book. It is a really moving story that made me feel so many feels. I vaguely remember crying as I was reading, which rarely happens for me. I think about this story often, and I definitely want to re-read it soon!

## Homegoing - _Yaa Gyasi_

<img src="/images/homegoing.jpg" alt="Homegoing" width="175" height="250">

This is another novel I read for English class in high school. Some of my teachers really chose some solid books! _Homegoing_ tells the stories of two half-sisters born into different socioeconomic classes in 18th-century Ghana. Each successive chapter follows women in their lineages, their lives, and how the past generations flow into the next. All of the characters' stories are very moving on their own, and put together, they create a masterpiece. Gyasi's writing is exquisitely beautiful. I have also read _Transcendent Kingdom_ by Gyasi, and that was another 5-star read!

## The Vanishing Half - _Britt Bennett_

<img src="/images/the-vanishing-half.jpg" alt="The Vanishing Half" width="175" height="250">

Similar to _Homegoing_, _The Vanishing Half_ also follows two sisters. The sisters run away from their small, southern black community in the 1950s. One sister returns to the community to raise her black daughter, while the other passes as white, covers her identity and past, and starts a completely different life. The story follows the sisters and daughters and how their lives intertwine. It was a very moving story about identity, race, class, generational patterns, and resulting paths. After I finished this, I thought about the story and its characters for days, and it still pops into my head every now and then. It was a beautifully crafted and intricate novel whose pieces fit together well to tell a compelling story. 

## So You Want to Talk About Race? - _Ijeoma Oluo_

<img src="/images/so-you-want-to-talk-about-race.jpg" alt="So You Want to Talk About Race" width="175" height="250">

Growing up in a predominantly white town with little racial diversity, I realized as I grew older that I did not know very much about racial matters, systemic racism, discrimination, the histories that contribute to our current racial atmosphere, and more. This book is one of the first I read to educate myself on these matters, and it was a treasure trove of information. It introduces a plethora of different racial topics, and I was able to learn and grow a lot from what I read. 

## Where the Crawdads Sing - _Delia Owens_

<img src="/images/where-the-crawdads-sing.jpg" alt="Where the Crawdads Sing" width="175" height="250">

Another well-written novel about a girl who grows up off the grid after being abandoned by her family. It follows her childhood, teenage years, and early adult years as she is learning to survive in the marshland. There is a mystery component as well, as it is uncovering a murder case. I really liked how the chapters flipped between the present and the past, where we got to learn more about the main protagonist. I remember getting completely engrossed in this story and feeling very connected to the characters. Also love the descriptive writing since there is a considerable nature component. An amazing novel, and it also has a movie adaptation that turned out well in my opinion.

## Daring Greatly - _Brené Brown_

<img src="/images/daring-greatly.jpg" alt="Daring Greatly" width="175" height="250">

I read _Daring Greatly_ as part of a book club ran by my college physics professor! This book was life-changing for me because it focuses on vulnerability, which is something I had struggled with for a long time. It explains vulnerability, why it is hard to be vulnerable sometimes, how we shield ourselves from being vulnerable, and the power of taking down those walls to open up opportunities for deeper connection with others. This was a very critical book for me and I feel like it came at a much-needed time. 

## The Simple Path to Wealth - _J.L. Collins_

<img src="/images/simple-path-to-wealth.jpg" alt="Simple Path to Wealth" width="175" height="250">

Financial literacy is not a topic that was often discussed at home or at school for me growing up. However, when I was in college, I wanted to learn more about personal finance, so that I could manage my financial situations well and set myself up securely for the future. Personal finance can be an intimidating topic at first, and there are so many resources that it was almost overwhelming to figure out where to start. This is a great introduction to personal finance, and I like how simply it breaks down topics. It does not overcomplicate personal finance, and I feel like it gives a solid amount of information to still be very helpful.

## Better Than the Movies & Nothing Like the Movies - _Lynn Painter_

<img src="/images/better-than-the-movies.jpg" alt="Better Than the Movies" width="175" height="250"> <img src="/images/nothing-like-the-movies.jpg" alt="Nothing Like the Movies" width="175" height="250">

I read quite a bit of contemporary/romance/rom-coms. Since I read a lot of them and they can be somewhat predictable, it takes a lot for them to stand out and make a favorites list. _Better Than the Movies_ and its sequel, _Nothing Like the Movies_ are so cute - I couldn't get enough of them. I absolutely love the main characters, their banter, and the connection that they have. I love all of the rom-com and pop culture references because I understood them and they add so much to the story. Also, something about the writing and the characters gave me a giddy feeling that brought me so much joy as I was reading. I recommend this to all who love a light-hearted story and those who love love.
