This post is part of my series where I am sharing different reflections I like to do at the end of each calendar year. Click [here](https://sarah-hourihan.github.io/posts/2024/12/end-of-year-routine/) to view my original post where I outline the different areas I like to reflect on. 

In 2022, I started doing a financial reflection at the end of each year. Personal finance is an area I was not super knowledgeable on for many years, but I think it is important to have a baseline understanding of personal finance. Through learning more, I have been able to manage my finances better and feel more secure.

For those who are starting their personal finance journeys, I recommend the book [_The Simple Path to Wealth_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30646587-the-simple-path-to-wealth) by J.L. Collins and the ["How to Money"](https://www.howtomoney.com/) podcast. Personal finance can be overwhelming to take in at first, but these sources explain them simply but thoroughly. I like that they don't throw in too much jargon, which made them accessible to me when I did not know as much.

In these personal finance focused posts, I also do not claim to be an expert in personal finance. I am on my own journey, and I still have a lot of learning and growth to do! I am always looking to learn more, and I am open to recommendations for resources if you have any favorites. 

However, I still think sharing my experiences and journey is worthwhile, so here is an overview of the financial reflection I like to do each year. Even though I track my finances on shorter timescales as well, it is still helpful to do a yearly reflection to recap my year and to notice trends that occur on longer timescales. 

My annual financial reflection consists of six questions: 

1. How do I feel about my finances in this moment?
2. Where did I enjoy spending money this year?
3. Where did I dislike spending money this year?
4. How did I do with achieving/working toward my financial goals?
5. What are my biggest strengths and weaknesses when it comes to money?
6. How well did I stick to my spending plan?

All of the questions are mostly self-explanatory, and you can write in as little or as much detail as you would like. I'll share a bit about what I include for each question. 

## 1. How do I feel about my finances in this moment?
This section is essentially a brain dump of how I'm feeling at the given moment I do the reflection. I'll write about if I'm feeling secure or anxious, and what is contributing to those feelings. I also will sometimes include highlights and lowlights from the year.

## 2. Where did I enjoy spending money this year?
For this question, I look at my monthly expense trackers and pick out things or areas I enjoyed spending money on this year. In 2024, I enjoyed spending money on new restaurants and cafes, gifts for others, and experiences with family and friends. 

## 3. Where did I dislike spending money this year?
Like the last question, my monthly expense trackers help me answer this question too, as they remind me where my money went over the year. For this question, I focus on non-essential areas that I didn't love spending money on. In 2024, I disliked spending money on parking garage fees and overpriced (in my opinion) restaurants. 

## 4. How did I do with achieving/working toward my financial goals?â€¨
As part of my yearly goals, I usually include a few financial goals. Here, I write about my progress toward those goals. 

## 5. What are my biggest strengths and weaknesses when it comes to money?
Another self-explanatory question. Here, I'll write about areas I feel like I am doing well in, and areas that I would like to improve. For example, my strengths include having a desire to increase my financial literacy, closely tracking expenses to stay aware of my spending habits, and less impulse spending than the past. Weaknesses include not having a 100% healthy money mindset, a tendency to spend more money than I would like to in social situations, and continuing to align my money mindset with spiritual beliefs/personal convictions. 

## 6. How well did I stick to my spending plan?
At the beginning of each year, I set a budget for myself. The budget can fluctuate, especially if I enter a new stage of life where my expenses and needs change. For example, I started grad school this year and moved to a new city, so my finances shifted a little bit. For this question, I glance at my monthly budgets, and identify areas I was able to meet and those I consistently went over in. This helps me pinpoint areas I can adjust my budget for in order to be more realistic. It also helps me identify areas that I may need more self-control in. 

## Closing thoughts
Annual financial reflections have been really helpful for me over the years! It isn't meant to be off-putting or stress-inducing. Rather, it helps me evaluate my current situation and illuminate paths to move forward.
