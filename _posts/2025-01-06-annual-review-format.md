In 2022, I started writing an annual review at the end of each year. The end of the year presents an opportune time to reflect, illuminate highlights, think about what didn’t go well, see if there are any changes you want to make in the future, and recall life lessons learned.

For my annual review, I follow an adapted version of a format shared by James Clear (the author of _Atomic Habits_) on his blog. Here is the original blog article if you wanted to read more about it from the source: [James Clear Annual Review](https://jamesclear.com/annual-review). Essentially, my annual review answers four questions: 

1. What went well?
2. What didn’t go well?
3. What have I learned?
4. What am I working toward?

All of the questions are open-ended, so you can really run with them however you would like. I’ll share a little bit about what I include in mine. 

## 1. What went well?
Here, I break my life into different areas and reflect on what went well within those areas, progress made in those areas, and accomplishments I was able to achieve in those areas. Examples of areas I have included in the past are research, academics, physical health, reading, finances, travel, faith, and mental health. 

## 2. What didn’t go well?
These section is a little less structured. Usually, I take time to reflect on areas that did not go so well, things I failed at, things that were energy draining, and things that caused me stress. Examples are not meeting a goal, feeling imposter syndrome, unresolved questions that cause inner conflict, and impulse spending. 

## 3. What have I learned? 
Obviously, there is a lot learned each year, and even each day if you want to break it down that far. As an academic and lifelong learner, I am always learning new things. However, the focus of this section is more big picture, life-focused. I think about bigger life lessons I learned this year, which often stem from personal experiences. An example is how I learned about the amount of intentional effort it takes to maintain relationships, especially long-distance ones. After graduating college, I have made it a point to try to keep up with my college friends, despite most of them living thousands of miles away.

## 4. What am I working toward? 
Here, I include a list of things I envision for the upcoming year. This is closely tied to my goals for the year, but not necessarily the exact same. Examples of things I am working toward in 2025 are finding a sustainable work-life balance, concentrating my research work during the day, becoming more involved in my local community, spending less time on social media, and continuing to learn Mandarin. 

## Closing thoughts
Annual reviews have been a really helpful way for me to recap my year, reflect on things that went well and didn't go well, and intentionally look forward to the next year. If you are feeling compelled to do an annual review of your own, I definitely recommend it! It can even be a quick jotted down list if journaling isn't really your thing. Also, there are a bunch of different formats released online that contain other questions, so do what works best for you.
