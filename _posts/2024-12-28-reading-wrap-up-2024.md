Last December, I had a lot of fun sharing the [books I read in 2023](https://sarah-hourihan.github.io/posts/2023/12/reading-year-in-review/), so I am doing a similar post for 2024!

In 2024, I read 50 books, which I am quite satisfied with. I have so many books I want to read, so it is always nice to see that I am getting through a decent chunk of them. At the beginning of the year, I set a goal to read at least 40 books, so I am glad I was able to reach that goal. Although I still prefer physical books, I also like renting books and audiobooks on [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) and the Kindle app.

According to Goodreads, in 2024 I read 17,479 pages, my average book length was 342 pages, and my average rating given was 3.2 stars (out of 5). If you would like to keep up with what I have been reading in real time, check out [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43349595-sarah)!

Below is a list of all the books I read in 2024, along with what I rated them. Check out [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43349595-sarah) for brief reviews of each book. ***Scroll to the bottom of this post for a list of my favorite books I read in 2024!***

# My Favorite Books of 2024

When I choose my favorite books each year, there are two factors I consider: 1) the original rating I gave to the book right after reading and 2) how I feel about the book once time has passed. Sometimes, when time goes by, the sparkle of a book I initially loved wears off. On the flipside, sometimes I read a book that I didn't absolutely _love_ at first, but the characters and plot stick with me. Also, I do not include re-read books. If I re-read a book, it most likely means it was already a favorite of mine. 

In no particular order, here is the list of my favorite books of 2024: 

- _Little Fires Everywhere_ by Celeste Ng
- _Better than the Movies_ by Lynn Painter
- _Nothing Like the Movies_ by Lynn Painter
- _The Only One Left_ by Riley Sager
- _The Paradise Problem_ by Christina Lauren
- _Yours Truly_ by Abby Jimenez
- _Just for the Summer_ by Abby Jimenez
- _All You Can Ever Know_ by Nicole Chung
