At the end of each year, I enjoy reflecting back on the books I read from that year. Normally, I do this in one of the physical journals I keep, but I figured why not share my 2023 Reading Wrap Up on my new blog. Thus, here we are! I present to you...my 2023 Reading Wrap Up! 

In 2023, I read 51 books, which I am very satisfied with. Reading has been one of my favorite pastimes since middle school, but it has been a bit tough to find time for it as a college student. However, this year, I think I discovered the key to reading as a busy college student...the Libby app! If you haven't heard of it, [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) allows you to rent e-books and audiobooks from your local library. Nowadays, I almost always have an e-book and audiobook rented from Libby. Whenever I have a few minutes of downtime, I read my e-book. If I'm commuting to campus, walking around between classes, or performing a routine task in lab, I listen to my audiobook. Libby has truly been a gamechanger!

A few stats about my year according to Goodreads: In 2023, I read 15,119 pages, my average book length was 296 pages, and my average rating given was 3.2 stars (out of 5). If you would like to keep up with what I have been reading in real time, check out [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43349595-sarah). I have been faithfully updating it since 2015.

Below is a list of all the books I read in 2023, along with what I rated them. Check out [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43349595-sarah) for reviews I left some of the books. ***Scroll to the bottom of this post for a list of the best books I read in 2023.***

# The Best Books I Read in 2023

When I choose my favorite books each year, there are two factors I consider: 1) the original rating I gave to the book right after reading and 2) how I feel about the book once time has passed. Sometimes, when time goes by, the sparkle of a book I initially loved wears off. On the flipside, sometimes I read a book that I didn't absolutely _love_ at first, but the characters and plot stick with me. Also, I do not include re-read books. If I re-read a book, it most likely means it was already a favorite of mine. 

Without further ado...in no particular order...I present the best books I read in 2023. 

- _Transcendent Kingdom_ by Yaa Gyasi
- _Daring Greatly_ by Brené Brown
- _The Simple Path to Wealth_ by J.L. Collins
- _Happy Place_ by Emily Henry
- _The Gifts of Imperfection_ by Brené Brown
- _Love, Theoretically_ by Ali Hazelwood
- _Burn_ by Herman Pontzer

Thank you for joining me as I wrapped up my 2023 reading year. Looking forward to more book-ish posts in the new year!
