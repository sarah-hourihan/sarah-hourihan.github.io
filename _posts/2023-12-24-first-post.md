Hello, welcome to my blog!

From a young age, I have LOVED journaling. As far as I can remember, I have kept journals for all sorts of things - brain dumps, reading, life goals, travel, reflections, and more. Exhibit A of my extensive amount of journals: 


Along with being able to document my life and process things, it is so fun to look back at old journals and remember details about everyday life that would be difficult to recall otherwise. Just the other day, I was looking back at a journal I kept when I was ~7 years old that mostly contains entries of me complaining about things my sister did (like most siblings, we have our moments, especially when we were younger). An old travel journal I was flipping through had tales of my family's cross-country road trip across the US to different national parks. I'm grateful to have these journals to look back at different stages of my life.

On my blog, expect to find glimpses into my life, reflections, advice, and musings of a young professional who is navigating higher education and early adulthood.

Though this blog is situated on my professional website, not all posts will relate to my professional life. Some of the posts will be written more casually. The intention for this blog is to document my life through writing.

Again, welcome to my blog!
