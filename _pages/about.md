Hi, I'm Sarah! I am passionate about evolutionary biology and maximizing participation in STEM. Currently, I am completing my undergraduate studies at Vanderbilt University, where I study Ecology, Evolution, & Organismal Biology (EEOB) and Music (Clarinet). For the past 3 years, I have researched birdsong evolution in the Creanza Lab at Vanderbilt.
