Plenary talk entitled "Significant song differences between subspecies of the dark-eyed junco" at the 2023 Beckman Foundation Symposium. This conference was the culmination of my time as an Arnold & Mabel Beckman Scholar! I was selected as one of eight Beckman Scholars nationwide to give a plentary talk.
