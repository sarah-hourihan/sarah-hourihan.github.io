# _Daring Greatly_ Reflection

During my Spring 2023 semester at Vanderbilt University, I joined a book club led by my physics professor, Dr. Savanna Starko. We read and discussed _Daring Greatly_ by Dr. Brené Brown. I was somewhat familiar with Dr. Brown's work through listening to her podcast, Unlocking Us, so I was super excited when I found out the book club was reading _Daring Greatly_.

The main focus of _Daring Greatly_ is vulnerability. Dr. Brown explains what vulnerability is, why it is difficult to practice, and the shields people use to protect themselves from vulnerability.

As someone who struggles with being vulnerable, this book was very insightful for me and helped me discover why it is difficult for me to be vulnerable. This book helped me feel seen by discussing feelings I hadn't been able to put into words before. In addition, this book provided an encouraging push to be more vulnerable. 

As I write this months after finishing _Daring Greatly_, my main takeaway was that vulnerability allows us to be seen by other people, thus allowing for deeper connections. Importantly, vulnerability should happen between individuals once trust and boundaries have been established.

# _Daring Greatly_ Notes

As I read _Daring Greatly_, I tabbed some of the statements that were especially meaningful to me. Below are notes from the pages I tabbed. This is not meant to be a summary of the book, as there are several insights from the book that are not included in my notes.

## Prologue: What It Means to Dare Greatly

- Vulnerability isn’t weakness. In fact, it takes great strength and courage to be vulnerable.
- With vulnerability comes uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. These are some of the barriers that prevent vulnerability.
- Lack of vulnerability often goes along with trying to maintain an image. Instead of sharing the difficult parts of life, those who are not vulnerable make it look like they have their life "together." However, this actually sacrifices relationships and opportunities.

## Introduction: My Adventures in the Arena

- Dr. Brown has 10 “guideposts” for wholehearted living:
    1. Cultivate authenticity: let go of what people think
    2. Cultivate self-compassion: let go of perfectionism
    3. Cultivate a resilient spirit: let go of numbing and powerlessness
    4. Cultivate gratitude and joy: let go of scarcity and fear of the dark
    5. Cultivate intuition and trusting faith: let go of the need for certainty
    6. Cultivate creativity: let go of comparison
    7. Cultivate play and rest: let go of exhaustion as a status symbol and productivity as self-worth
    8. Cultivate calm and stillness: let go of anxiety as a lifestyle
    9. Cultivate meaningful work: let go of self-doubt and “supposed to”
    10. Cultivate laughter, song, and dance: let go of being cool and “always in control”
- These come from Dr. Brown's other book, _The Gifts of Imperfection_. 
- If you try to be perfect and rule out failure, you forget about learning, creativity, and innovation. 

## Chapter 1: Scarcity: Looking Inside Our Culture of “Never Enough”

- Scarcity = Never ___ enough.
- A quote from Lynne Twist:
  > “We spend most of the hours and the days of our lives hearing, explaining, complaining, or worrying about what we don’t have enough of…Before we even sit up in bed, before our feet touch the floor, we’re already inadequate, already behind, already losing, already lacking something. And by the time we go to bed at night, our minds are racing with a litany of what we didn’t get, or didn’t get done, that day…This internal condition of scarcity, this mindset of scarcity, lives at the very heart of our jealousies, our greed, our prejudice, and our arguments with life.”

## Chapter 2: Debunking the Vulnerability Myths

- Rejection of vulnerability stems from associations with negative feelings like fear, shame, grief, sadness, and disappointment.
  - However, these emotions profoundly affect the way we live, love, work, and lead.
- Vulnerability leads to love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, creativity, hope, accountability, and authenticity.
- Many of us think: *Vulnerability is courage in you and inadequacy in me. I’m drawn to your vulnerability but repelled by mine.*
- Vulnerability is based on mutuality and requires boundaries and trust.
  - For clarification, it isn’t oversharing, purging, or emotional dumping.
- Vulnerability without boundaries leads to disconnection, distrust, and disengagement.
  - Do not use vulnerability to deal with unmet needs or as a ploy to get attention.

## Chapter 3: Understanding and Combating Shame

- Shame resilience is key to embracing vulnerability. You can’t let yourself be seen if you are terrified by what people might think.
- Don’t attach self-worth to your art, product, or performance.
- Shame tends to lurk in familiar places. 12 shame categories have emerged:
    1. Appearance and body image
    2. Money and work
    3. Motherhood/fatherhood
    4. Family
    5. Parenting
    6. Mental and physical health
    7. Addiction
    8. Sex
    9. Aging
    10. Religion
    11. Surviving trauma
    12. Being stereotyped or labeled
- There is a difference between guilt and shame. Guilt = I _did_ something did. Shame = I _am_ bad.
  - Guilt is positive because it leads to improve or rightful apologies.
  - Shame is destructive because it corrodes the belief that you can change and do better.
- To build shame resilience:
    1. Practice courage and reach out to people
    2. Talk to yourself the way you’d talk to someone you love
    3. Own your story

## Chapter 4: The Vulnerability Armory

- There are 3 main shields against vulnerability: perfectionism, numbing, and oversharing.
- Perfectionism _is not_ the same as striving for excellence.
  - It’s not about healthy achievement and self-improvement.
  - It’s a defensive move. It’s the belief that if you do things perfectly, you can minimize judgement and shame.
  - It actually hampers achievement and is correlated with depression, anxiety, addiction, and missed opportunities.
- Numbing and distracting (e.g. with food, work, social media) doesn’t remove the pain of difficult experiences.
  - "Numbing" activities aren't inherently bad; rather, it is the intention for engaging in the activities.
- Ironically, oversharing can be a vulnerability shield.
  - Share with people who have earned the right and can bear the weight of your story.

## Chapter 7: Wholehearted Parenting: Daring to Be the Adults We Want Our Children to Be

- Who you are and how you engage with the world are strong predictors of how your children will be.
- Your sense of love, belonging, and worthiness is largely shaped by your family of origin—what you hear, what you're told, and how you observe your parents engaging with the world.
  - Perfectionism is contagious and can pass to your kids. It teaches them to value what other people think over what they think or how they feel.
  - Separate children from their behaviors. If you shame your children, you take away opportunity to grow.
    - Childhood experiences of shame change who you are, how you think about yourself, and your sense of self-worth.
- Invest time and energy into understanding childrens' worlds, their interests, and their stories.
- Raising children who have the courage to be vulnerable means stepping back and letting them experience disappointment, conflict, and failure.
