In January 2023, I was hired by the Vanderbilt Department of Biological Sciences to serve as a teaching assistant for Evolution (BSCI 2205). In this role, I host weekly office hours for students to ask questions and work through problems that apply evolutionary concepts. I also hold review sessions before each exam.
