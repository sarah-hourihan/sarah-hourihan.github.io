Hello, welcome to my blog!

On my professional blog, expect to find reflections, advice, and musings of a young professional who is navigating higher education and early adulthood. I hope to document my journey through academia and help others along the way through sharing my experiences.

Also, feel free to check out my [personal blog](https://sarahhourihan.substack.com/) on Substack, where I share my non-research-related posts. There, you'll find book reviews, personal reflections, and more.

Again, welcome to my blog!
