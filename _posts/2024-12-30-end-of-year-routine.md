The end of the year is honestly one of my favorite seasons. Outside of the holidays, I view it as an opportunity to reflect on the past year and set intentions for the year to come. Yes, I wholeheartedly believe in reflecting on smaller intervals as well (months, weeks, days, etc), but the end of the year feels like the perfect time to do a larger scale reflection. 

End-of-year reflections and new-year intentions are things I have enjoyed for years, as evidenced by the numerous journal entries I have written that date back to middle school. Just the other day, I stumbled upon some of my old journals, and I found reflections and goals from years past. It is really cool to see what I was up to back then (as sometimes it is easy to forget) and also see how far I have come since then. 

As you can tell, I am a huge proponent of doing these types of reflections! I definitely recommend others to partake if it is something they are interested in, because things become more concrete when you write them down. Taking time to do these activities forces me to reflect in detail on the past year, and also think intentionally about what I envision for the upcoming year.

In this post, I will be sharing what I do to reflect at the end of the year, and also how I set intentions for a new year. Click on the hyperlinks to get more information about how I structure them.

For the reading wrap up, I go over all of the books I have read in a given year. I also take it as an opportunity to choose which were my favorites. By laying out all of the books, I can see the genre breakdown, ratio of fiction to nonfiction, and think about what I want to read in the next year.
