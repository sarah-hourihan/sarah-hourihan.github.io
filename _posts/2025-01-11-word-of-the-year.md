This post is part of my series where I am sharing different exercises I like to do at the end of each calendar year. Click [here](https://sarah-hourihan.github.io/posts/2024/12/end-of-year-routine/) to view my original post that outlines the different areas I like to reflect on. 

At the end of each year, I like to choose a Word of the Year for the upcoming year. Identifying a Word of the Year sets an intention for the future. It is a succinct way to capture what you hope to find or embody throughout the coming year. 

While I know some people are very introspective in choosing their Word of the Year, my process is much more casual. Before a new year, Morgan Harper Nichols, a digital creator I follow on Instagram, uploads a post to help people find a word for the upcoming year. The post rapidly flips through a bunch of different words, and viewers randomly screenshot the post to get a word. This has been a fun way to choose a Word of the Year, and oftentimes, they are actually fitting with my current life stage. Click [here](https://www.instagram.com/morganharpernichols/reel/DEFT6oMutJZ/) to view Morgan's Word of the Year post for 2025, and I encourage you to check out her work. I love her artistry and her way with words. I always find the posts inspirational and uplifting. 

Without further ado, my 2025 Word of the Year is:

## BREAKTHROUGHS

Honestly, this is quite fitting for my current stage of life. There have been times in my life when I have held myself back. Times when I have let doubt, fear, and self-limiting beliefs keep me from action. Times when I have constructed walls to 'protect' myself, but it was only keeping me from building deeper connections with others. 

Here's to breaking through mental blocks, doubts, fears, and self-limiting beliefs in 2025.
