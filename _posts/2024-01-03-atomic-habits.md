# _Atomic Habits_ Reflection

In December 2022, I read _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear. This book has received a lot of hype in the last few years, and it is definitely well-deserved. I am typically a bit skeptical about self-help and self-improvement books, but I genuinely learned a lot from _Atomic Habits_. Clear gives actionable, realistic advice, which is what makes this book so effective. The writing is also relatively easy to comprehend and not overly technical, which makes it accessible and enjoyable for all types of readers.

After reading _Atomic Habits_, I was able to implement habits I hadn't been able to stick to before: Having a solid morning and night routine, getting enough sleep, being consistent with my gratitude journal, going to the gym at 7 a.m. in the morning (a feat I never would have imagined for myself previously), and more. Although it is cheesy to say, _Atomic Habits_ inspired me to live my best life. Though I am far from perfect and still slip up on habits I have set, this book has given me a solid understanding of setting and implementing habits.

For my first post of 2024, what better way to kick off the new year than with a post about _Atomic Habits_! Of course, habits and goals don't have to begin at the beginning of the year. They can begin at any time, as each moment can be a fresh start. 

This post is honestly just as helpful for me as it is to others—my memory of _Atomic Habits_ has gotten a little fuzzy since I first read it in 2022. I am looking forward to re-visiting my notes, which will hopefully help get my new year off to a strong start. 

I rated _Atomic Habits_ 5 out of 5 stars. I'm not being dramatic when I say the book was truly life-changing! To this day, I am still implementing what I have learned and I often think about the book. When a book sticks with you in that way, you know it's a keeper. :)

# _Atomic Habits_ Notes

As I read _Atomic Habits_, I noted some of the statements that were especially intriguing to me. Below are my notes, organized by sections and chapters. This is **not** meant to be a summary of the book.

## The Fundamentals - Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

### Chapter 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

- We underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis: 1% better each day for a year -> 36.5x better by the end of the year
  - Honestly this point felt unrealistic to me since everyone has ups and downs. I don't think it's healthy to keep pushing yourself for the sake of improvement if you are having a difficult time. However, the overarching idea is that small improvements can amount to big results.
- Systems are better than goals
  - Goals = centered around achieving a result. System = process that continually leads to results.
  - Goals are momentary but systems bring long-lasting change.
- Atomic Habit = A regular practice or routine that is small and easy to do but is the source of incredible power.

### Chapter 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

- It is difficult to change your habits if underlying beliefs about yourself that led to past behaviors are still there.
  - Example: saying "I'm not athletic" as a reason to not exercise.
  - Identity often affects behavior - if you label yourself as not athletic, you are less likely to exercise.
- You may need to edit the beliefs you have about yourself when you are building a new habit.
- In turn, habits shape your identity; the more you do something, the more identity you have in it.

### Chapter 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

- Habits reduce our cognitive load and free up mental capacity to focus on other things.
  - Habits can be viewed as strict and restrictive, but they actually create more freedom!
- The 4 laws to build better habits:
  1. Cue - Make the habit obvious
  2. Craving - Make the habit attractive
  3. Response - Make the habit easy
  4. Reward - Make the habit satisfying
- To break bad habits, you invert the laws:
  1. Make the bad habit invisible
  2. Make the bad habit unattractive
  3. Make the bad habit difficult
  4. Make the bad habit unsatisfying

## The 1st Law - Make It Obvious

### Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn't Look Right

- Actions can result from the automatic and unconcious mind. Notice patterns you have fallen into without meaning to.
- Action Item: Create a 'habits scorecard' of your day and rate each habit good, bad, or neutral.

### Chapter 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit

- Set an **implementation intention**: I will \*insert behavior\* at \*insert time\* in \*insert location\*.
- **Habit stack**: After \*current habit\*, I will \*new habit\*.
- The key to both methods is to make the plans **specific**.

### Chapter 6: Motivation is Over-rated; Environment Often Matters More

- Habits change depending on where you are and the cues that environments bring.
- You can re-design your environment to make a habit cue more noticeable.
- Sometimes it is easier to build a new habit in a new environment so you are not fighting against old cues.

### Chapter 7: The Secret to Self-Control
- 'Disciplined' people structure their lives in a way that doesn't require heroic willpower.
  - Spend less time in tempting situations.
  - Cut bad habits off at the source by reducing exposure to the cue that causes it.
- Once a habit is formed, it is easier to follow and becomes part of your routine. 

## The 2nd Law - Make It Attractive

### Chapter 8: How to Make a Habit Irrestible

- Dopamine is released when you experience pleasure AND when you anticipate it.
- Anticipation of reward—not fulfillment of it—is what gets us to take action.
- **Temptation bundling**: link an action you want to do with an action you already need to do.

### Chapter 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
- We imitate those in close proximity to us.
- Be a part of communities where:
  1. Your desired behavior is the normal behavior
  2. You have something in common with the group

### Chapter 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

- Re-program your brain to enjoy difficult habits—you don't 'have to' do something, you 'get to' do it.
- Make bad habits unattractive by focusing on the benefits of avoiding them.
  - Think about the positive reward that will come from not doing the bad habit.

## The 3rd Law - Make It Easy

### Chapter 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

- Trying to make the optimal plan for change keeps us from taking action.
- Planning can actually be a form of procrastination
- Habits form based on frequency, not time. Therefore, it's sometimes better to just get started.

### Chapter 12: The Law of Least Effort

- We are motivated to do what's easy
  - **Make habits easy** so you'll do them even when you don't feel like it
- Create barriers against bad habits
  - Example: delete social media apps off your phone if you want to spend less time scrolling.
 
### Chapter 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the 2-Minute Rule

- Little choices add up, with each setting the trajectory of how you'll spend your time
  - Example: picking up your phone and scrolling social media vs. not picking up your phone to begin with
- **When you start a new habit, it should take 2 minutes or less to complete**
  - Make habits easy so you're more likely to stick to it
  - New habits shouldn't feel extremely daunting
- Shape habits into phases to slowly do more and more
  - Example: Becoming an early riser
    - Phase 1: Be home by 10 p.m. every night
    - Phase 2: Have all devices away by 10 p.m.
    - Phase 3: Be in bed by 10 p.m. every night
    - Phase 4: Have lights out by 10 p.m. every night
    - Phase 5: Wake up at 6 a.m. every day

### Chapter 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

- Some one-time actions pay off time and time again:
  - Unsubscribing from email lists
  - Turning your phone on silent
  - Deleting social media apps
- Automate parts of your life to free up time

## The 4th Law - Make It Satisfying

### Chapter 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

- Make a habit satisfying to do it more often
- We prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones (instant gratification)
- Add bits of immediate reward for completing a positive habit

### Chapter 16: How to Stick with Good Habits

- **Use a habit tracker** to visualize your progress on habits
- **If you miss one day, get back to it asap**. Missing 2 days in a row increases the chances you'll miss more.

### Chapter 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

- If there's a consequence to our behaviors, it is more likely to stop.
- Habit contract: a way to add an immediate cost to a bad habit.
  - Verbal or written agreement stating commitment to a habit and a consequence if you don't follow it.
- Use other people as accountability partners.
  - Knowing someone is watching can be a powerful motivator.

## Advanced Tactics - How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great

### Chapter 18: The Truth About Talent

- Habits are easier if they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.
  - Direct your effort toward areas that excite you and match your skill.
- Choose habits that best suit you, which may not be the most popular option.

### Chapter 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work

- **Goldilock's Rule**: Maintain motivation by working on tasks of manageable difficulty
- **Flow state**: a.k.a. being 'in the zone.' Tasks should be ~4% above your current ability.

I hope these notes were interesting and/or helpful! Definitely read _Atomic Habits_ if you would like to go more in depth with any of these points.
